# ActiveRecord Basics

#### About

*ActiveRecord is a part of Ruby Rails' MVC pattern that allows us to circumvent the need
for SQL and run database commands from within your app. Active Record makes it easy to create and manipulate objects whose data is stored in a database.

#### Types

Queries

* ActiveRecord queries allow us to sift through databases and pinpoint the
data we want to obtain.

Calculations

* ActiveRecord calculations allow us to perform the manipulation of data
without leaving our Rails application.

ActiveRecord Models

* ActiveRecord models inherit from ApplicationRecord, and map to a corresponding
table in a database. These models often hold methods that can be called on the
model elsewhere in your Rails app.

ActiveRecord CRUD

* ActiveRecord models are typically called in controllers to implement create,
read, update, and destroy functionality in your Rails app.
