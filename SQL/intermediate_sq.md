## Intermediate SQL Workshop


* Run `psql`
* You may need to run `CREATE DATABASE intermediate_sql;` 
* To exit this shell, you can run `CTRL` `d`

#### Create tables

Let's create some tables in the database.
```
CREATE TABLE students(id SERIAL, name TEXT);
CREATE TABLE classes(id SERIAL, name TEXT, teacher_id INT);
CREATE TABLE teachers(id SERIAL, name TEXT, room_number INT);
CREATE TABLE enrollments(id SERIAL, student_id INT, class_id INT, grade INT);
```

#### Add data

Let's insert some students.

```
INSERT INTO students (name)
VALUES ('Penelope'),
       ('Peter'),

       ('Patricia'),
       ('Piper'),
       ('Paula'),
       ('Pamela'),
       ('Paige'),

       ('Pedro'),
       ('Phoebe'),
       ('Pajak'),
       ('Parker'),
       ('Priyal'),

```

Let's add some teachers.

```

INSERT INTO enrollments (student_id, class_id, grade)
VALUES (1, 1, 60),
       (2, 2, 70),
       (2, 4, 100),
       (3, 2, 74),
       (4, 3, 82),
       (5, 3, 45),
       (5, 4, 50),
       (7, 11, 62),
       (7, 10, 76),
       (7, 9, 81),
       (7, 8, 91),
       (8, 8, 84),
       (9, 8, 88),
       (9, 7, 83),
       (10, 7, 93),
       (10, 5, 95),
       (11, 5, 95),

       (19, 4, 84),
       (20, 1, 85),
       (20, 11, 89),
       (20, 3, 98);
```

### Practice!!
* List all the students and their classes

```sql
SELECT s.name, c.name 
FROM students s
INNER JOIN enrollments e
ON s.id = e.student_id
INNER JOIN classes c
ON c.id = e.class_id
ORDER BY s.name;
```
* List all the students and their classes and rename the columns to "student" and "class"

```sql
SELECT s.name students, c.name classes 
FROM students s
INNER JOIN enrollments e
ON s.id = e.student_id
INNER JOIN classes c
ON c.id = e.class_id
ORDER BY s.name;
```
* List all the students and their average grade

```sql
SELECT s.name student, avg(e.grade) AS average_grade
FROM students s
JOIN enrollments e
ON s.id = e.student_id
GROUP BY student
ORDER BY average_grade DESC;
```
* List all the students and a count of how many classes they are currently enrolled in

```sql
SELECT s.name student, count(e.id) AS total_classes
FROM students s                                                                                                         
LEFT JOIN enrollments e                                                                                                 
ON s.id = e.student_id                                                                                                 
GROUP BY student
ORDER BY total_classes DESC;
```
* List all the students and their class count IF they are in more than 2 classes

```sql
SELECT s.name student, count(e.id) AS total_classes
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN enrollments e
ON s.id = e.student_id
GROUP BY student
HAVING count(e.id) > 2
ORDER BY total_classes DESC;
```
* List all the teachers for each student

```sql
SELECT s.name student, t.name teacher
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN enrollments e
ON s.id = e.student_id
LEFT JOIN classes c
ON c.id = e.class_id
LEFT JOIN teachers t
ON t.id = c.teacher_id
ORDER BY student ASC;
```
* List all the teachers for each student grouped by each student
* Find the average grade for each class

```sql
SELECT c.name class_name, avg(e.grade) AS average_grade
FROM classes c
LEFT JOIN enrollments e
ON c.id = e.class_id
GROUP BY class_name
ORDER BY average_grade DESC;
```
* List students' name and their grade IF their grade is lower than the average.

```sql
SELECT s.name student, avg(e.grade) AS average_grade
FROM students s
JOIN enrollments e
ON s.id = e.student_id
GROUP BY student
HAVING avg(e.grade) < (SELECT avg(grade) FROM enrollments)
ORDER BY average_grade DESC;
```
